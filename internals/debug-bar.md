Debug Bar
=========

If you're logged in, and 'debug: true' is set in `config.yml`, you'll see the
'Debug nut' in the lower right corner of all pages of both the frontend and the
backend of the Bolt website. Click it to open the Symfony profiler bar.

This profiler bar contains a lot of useful information to see what's going on
behind the scenes. Click the different tabs to see information about the current
request, used templates, matched routes, used queries, server variables and a
lot more.
