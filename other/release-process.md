Release Process
===============

Since branching Bolt v1 and onwards, we've spent time
thinking about how - as a community based project - we could best manage our release
process.

Some of the points that we're trying to consider in this discussion are:

 - Keep the project moving, don't stagnate
 - Keep our processes in line with our vision of simplicity
 - Keep the management of processes from interfering with the fun we have
   writing the code, documentation, and community interaction
 - Learn from the success of other projects, as well as from their mistakes
 - Release early, release often!

Schedule & Roadmap
------------------

Release schedules follow the basic pattern of:

 - 14 day feature window (hard limit)
 - 14 day bug fix window (soft end-limit)
 - 14 day contingency window (only if required)
 - Release!

An example would be:

| Window   | Open (09:00 UTC) | Close (midnight UTC) |
|----------|------------------|----------------------|
| Feature  | 09 March 2016    | 22 March 2016        |
| Bug Fix  | 23 March 2016    | 05 April 2016        |
| Release  | 06 April 2016    | n/a                  |
