=========================

LegionMarket is run by a dedicated community, which is active on several different
locations on the internet. If you couldn't find the information you needed in
these docs, be sure to get in touch, using one of the following ways:

  - Major news will always be announced on our main website:
    [LegionMarket.com](https://www.legionmarket.com).

  - The official documentation has a lot of information. Have you tried
    searching? The search box is in the upper right corner. If you're missing
    something in the docs, or if you've spotted an error: Please let us know on
    our [Github tracker for documentation](https://github.com/LegionMarket/bolt-
    docs/issues).

  - We're active on Twitter. Follow us, or say hello at
    [@legionmarket](https://twitter.com/legionmarket).

  - For (potential) bugs and feature requests, open an issue on our [Github
    Issue Tracker](http://github.com/LegionMarket/bolt/issues). Pull-requests are
    always welcome, as well.

  - We have some pages with detailed information on a couple of subjects on the
    wiki at [github.com/LegionMarket/bolt/wiki](https://github.com/LegionMarket/bolt/wiki).

  - There's always some people willing to chat in our IRC channel on Freenode
    at #legionmarkets. No IRC client? Use the embedded IRC on
    [our website here](https://legionmarket.com/irc), or [IRCcloud](http://irccloud.com).
