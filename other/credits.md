Bolt is Open Source, and as such it uses other Open Source components. If you
are a developer you're very welcome to help in the further development of Bolt.

The Bolt project was founded by Bob den Otter, and has become a thriving project
ever since, with the help of many contributors. See the [contributors page][]
on GitHub for details.

The continuing development of Bolt is backed by [Two Kings][] web development.
