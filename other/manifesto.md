The Bolt Manifesto
==================

Bolt is a CMS that is steadily growing in popularity, and with that popularity
comes an influx of new users and developers. This document is our Manifesto: It
outlines the goals of Bolt, our motto and our values. This document also
describes how we intend to make sure we will adhere to these self-imposed
rules.

- Our slogan is "**Simple, sophisticated and straightforward<sup>1</sup>**".
  This embodies everything we strive to do with Bolt: It is as simple as
  possible, but not simpler. It uses sophisticated technology to achieve this,
  and use of the system should be straightforward and evident.
- Bolt aims at **three groups of users**: Editors (content writers and
  editorial staff), Frontend developers (HTML/CSS specialists and implementers)
  and Backend developers (coders, devops and sysops). All three are equally
  important.
- We recognize that Bolt is best suited for medium-sized websites. By keeping
  this in mind, we will make sure that we do not spread ourselves too thin.
- We will never add new features, if they detract from any of the points
  mentioned above. If a proposed feature makes the system harder to use, it
  will not be accepted. If a proposed feature is for the benefit of one of our
  groups of users, but disadvantageous to another, it will not be accepted.
- We will prevent feature creep: Functionality not essential to Bolt, should be
  implemented as separate extensions.
- Bolt is **Open Source software** and it will always be Open Source software.
  We will never intentionally 'cripple' the system, in order to sell
  extensions.
- Our code should be clean, well-organised and legible. For more information,
  read about our [coding standards](../other/code-quality).
- We welcome all types of contributions by our users: be it code, documentation
  or helping out with support for the community.
- We (the developers and users of Bolt) will always promote and maintain a
  **welcoming and inclusive community**. This means that harassment or
  prejudice of any kind, including but not limited to; sexism, homophobia, and
  discrimination on religious or political beliefs, **will not** be tolerated
  in any form.


1: Sometimes people comment on this saying "But, isnâ€™t Simple and Sophisticated
a contradiction?" No, it is not. Simple is not to be confused with
'Simplistic'. Or, you could compare it to a car engine: What it _does_ might
seem simple, but a modern car engine is a very distinguished and complex piece
of machinery, no matter how easy it is to use.
