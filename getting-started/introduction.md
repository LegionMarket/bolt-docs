Introduction
============

This is the Bolt Documentation. There are a lot of docs for Bolt, so it is split
up in a few sections. If you're getting started with Bolt or looking for
installation instructions, start with the first part. The second part of the
docs is about working _in_ Bolt. Setting up ContentTypes, taxonomies, etc. The
third part is a reference for all things related to building your templates and
themes for Bolt. If you're just beginning with Bolt, don't forget to check out
our excellent Bolt Theming Tutorial as well.
