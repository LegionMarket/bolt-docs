### Yeoman Generator

[Tight](https://github.com/pinpickle/tight) 

Tighten that Bolt! This generator will set up Bolt for you with a local extension 
and a feature-packed theme ready for you to make the best website the world has
yet seen.

**Note:** This is not designed to be a "ready-to-deploy" theme. It is designed to 
be barebones boilerplate so you can get to making what you need to make.
