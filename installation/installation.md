Installing Bolt
===============

This page explains the various ways of installing Bolt. You can either use the
command-line or your FTP-client to install it. There are different methods to
install Bolt, but we recommend **The "easy way"**, as the fastest way to get an
installation of Bolt up and running.

Altogether, there are several installation options that suit any preferred workflow:

  - **The "easy way"**: Using the distribution files, to quickly set up a
    'Composer based' Bolt installation, [using the server command-line](install-command-line).
  - **The traditional way**: Uploading the files manually, [using (S)FTP](install-sftp).
  - **The composer way**: Using `composer create-project` or by creating your
    own `composer.json` file. [for developers](composer/install-composer).
  - **The Bolt contributor way**: Making a `git clone` and doing a direct
    checkout from our Github repository [for Bolt core development](install-git-clone).
  - **Integrating in your project**: To bootstrap the Bolt application in code,
    integrating it completely in an existing project, see [Creating your own Bootstrap](../extensions/custom-bootstrapping).

Use one of the five methods described above to get the Bolt source files, and
set them up on your web server. After you've done this, skip to the section for
[Setting up Bolt ](../configuration/introduction).
