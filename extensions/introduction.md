How To Use Bolt extensions
===========================

The core functionality of Bolt can be extended by taking advantage of the rich
ecosystem of extensions that are available on the [Bolt Marketplace][ext].

Discovering Extensions
----------------------

The [Bolt Extensions Marketplace][ext] is the place to discover new extensions.
You can search by name or keyword and also see what the most popular extensions
are.

Installing New Extensions
----------------------

Within the administration area of your Bolt site, if you have the correct
permissions you will see a link to 'Extend Bolt'.

Once you know the name of the extension as listed on the Marketplace then you
can use the installation form to add it to your Bolt site. Fill in the name and
click the *Browse Versions* button, this will launch a new window which will
show you versions of the extension that are compatible with the current version
of Bolt you are using.

Checking for Updated Versions
-----------------------------

From time to time it's good practice to update any installed extensions, this
allows developers to supply security updates along with added functionality.

Using the check for updates button (as shown above) you can see a list of
updates that are available and optionally install them one at a time.

Note that because installing updates will potentially affect the way your Bolt
site functions then it is important that you test updated extensions on a
staging version of the site to ensure that everything works correctly before you
update on a production site.

Security of Extensions
------------------------

It's important to remember that the majority of extensions are developed and
maintained by third party developers and you should be careful about reviewing
the source code (or asking somebody capable to review for you) before you
install on your Bolt Site.

If you think you have found a security bug you should contact both the developer
of the extension along with the Bolt core team.
