Creating the first user
=======================

*If your site has been setup by a designer or developer you will likely already
have login credentials and can skip to [login screen](login)*

When Bolt has been installed and you navigate to your site you will be greeted
by a screen asking you to create the first user:

<a href="/files/screenshots/user-first.png" class="popup"><img src="/files/screenshots/user-first.png" width="590"></a><br>

After you enter your info you will be redirected to the
[login screen](login)...
