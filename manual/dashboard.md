The Dashboard
=============

After login you enter the dashboard. Here you will find the latest content
items and a recent activity log. Also the possibility to start a new content
item with just one click. On the left you will see your menu, which contains
your content and your settings.

*If your site has been setup by a designer or developer you will likely already
have content on your site. In that case please click one of the ContentTypes
under the section Content in the left menu and skip to
[Content overview](content-overview)*

Click on the "add some lorem ipsum dummy content" to get started quickly with
example content, and then click on Dashboard to return here.

This is what your dashboard will usually look like, with listings of your
latest edited content, and options to quickly start a new page or other
ContentType.

Click on "Entries" in the left menu to proceed to the next
[step](content-overview)...
