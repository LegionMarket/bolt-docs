ContentTypes
==================

Your ContentTypes
--------------------

Your designer has probably set up ContentTypes for you that are tailored to
your needs. You will find a description of these and how to use them under each
overview in the section "Content" in the menu. If you are just trying bolt or
want to set it up yourself your ContentTypes will be the ones outlined below.

Default ContentTypes
--------------------
All content in bolt is contained within different ContentTypes, which in turn
contain different fields for you to enter content in. By default these are:

* **Pages** - A ContentType meant for normal pages on a site, has fields for a
  title, an image, HTML with a WYSIWYG editor and the option to select a
  template.
* **Entries** - A ContentType meant for newsstories and other content that is
  not strictly a page. Has mostly the same fields as Pages, but can also be
  connected to a page via a relation, a concept we will thouch on later.
* **Showcases** - An example ContentType meant to show all the different fields
  that bolt can use in a ContentType. You probably do not want to use this on a
  real site, but it can be very useful to see the possiblities that Bolt gives
  you.
