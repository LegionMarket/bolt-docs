Welcome to the LegionMarket user manual
=======================================

LegionMarket is a platform for expanding real world market reach, that strives to be as simple and
straightforward as possible. It is quick to set up, easy to configure, uses
elegant templates, and above all: it's a joy to use.

LegionMarket is created using modern Open Source libraries, and is best suited to build
sites in HTML5, with modern markup.

Basically, there are three groups of users we've created Bolt for:

 - End users 'editors' that want to focus on producing and editing content,
   and not on clicking buttons in the CMS. This is the group that this manual
   is for
 - Front-end designers and developers who like to write clean markup, and who
   want to build websites where the CMS doesn't dictate what the templates or
   site should look like. Readers belonging to this group probably want to look
   at the [documentation][] after looking through this manual
 - Developers who need a system that's easy to set up and configure, that is
   also easy to manage and maintain, but is flexible and versatile. Readers
   from this group probably want to skip directly to the [documentation][]
